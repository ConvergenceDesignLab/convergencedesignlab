        Natalia Smirnov is a Doctoral Candidate in Learning Sciences at Northwestern University. Her
        research explores how educators design for technology-mediated civic learning, especially in
        innovative and participatory learning environments. She has taught civic journalism, social
        justice-oriented media production, media literacy, web design and art-making to youth in
        Philly and Chicago, and founded Philadelphia's award-winning youth news show POPPYN.
        Natalia's recent academic writing appears in MIT's Civic Media Project, Contemporary Youth
        Activism: Advancing Social Justice in the United States, the journal Cognition &
        Instruction, and Encyclopedia of Language and Education. Always connecting theory to
        practice, Natalia loves to collaborate with learning organizations to design creative and
        culturally responsive evaluation tools.
