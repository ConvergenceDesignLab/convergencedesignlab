          at Columbia College Chicago. Columbia aims to be an animating force in our Chicago
          communities and in the larger world beyond. Convergence works to make this promise a
          reality by fostering deep connections between the college and the cultural, media, and
          learning sectors locally, nationally and globally.

          Convergence provides opportunities for the college to lead in area-wide conversations
          about emerging digital economies and information literacies while continuing to foster a
          strategic vision for Chicagoâ€™s connected city. Together, Convergence and SMA are exploring
          how digital technologies are transforming society and culture, producing new forms of
          interaction, and modeling new information ecosystems, and using that knowledge to design
          the future of participation, and empower and transform communities across the greater
          Chicago area.
